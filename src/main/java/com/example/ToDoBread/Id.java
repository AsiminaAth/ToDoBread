/*
defines a custom annotation named Id in the com.example.ToDoBread package. 
In Java, annotations are a form of metadata that provide data about a program but 
are not part of the program itself. Annotations have no direct effect on the operation 
of the code they annotate.

package com.example.ToDoBread;

public @interface Id {

}

/*
The Id annotation is defined using the @interface keyword, 
which is used to declare an annotation type. However, this particular Id annotation 
does not have any elements or methods defined within it, making it a marker annotation. 
Marker annotations are used to mark a declaration and provide information to the compiler 
or runtime without containing any additional data.

It is important to note that the Id annotation defined here is not the same 
as the @Id annotation provided by the Jakarta Persistence API (JPA), 
which is commonly used to mark a field as the primary key in an entity class. 
If the intention is to use the JPA @Id annotation, you should import it from 
the jakarta.persistence package instead of defining a custom annotation.

In summary, the Id annotation in this code snippet is a custom marker 
annotation with no elements. If the goal is to use it for marking primary 
key fields in JPA entities, it would be more appropriate to use the standard 
@Id annotation from the JPA library.
