Some definitions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ npx
npx is a package runner that comes with npm (Node Package Manager).
It allows you to execute packages without globally installing them.
In this case, it runs create-react-app without needing to install it separately.
2Ô∏è‚É£ create-react-app todo-frontend
create-react-app is a tool that sets up a new React project with a default configuration.
todo-frontend is the name of your new project directory.
It will create a new folder named todo-frontend and set up a React project inside it.
3Ô∏è‚É£ --template typescript
By default, create-react-app sets up a JavaScript-based React project.
Adding --template typescript makes it a TypeScript project instead of JavaScript.
